# MovieFlix

I created this application to fetch movie lists from [**TMDB**](https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/intro/getting-started) using React JS, Typescript, and SCSS.

The application provides user movies categorized by the release year having *2012* as default.

## Start App

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`
Firstly, install all the dependencies using the above script and then run the project using the below command:

### `npm start`

It runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Features 

* Provides a list of movies sorted by popularity and categories by *primary_release_year*.

* Loads Movies on scroll if you scroll up then the previous year's movies will be listed and on scroll down next year ones of the current ones will be shown.

* Filter is based on the selected genres and loads new ones on every check.

* Responsive for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

## Future Enhancement

* Scroll gets stuck at first, but once you move upward and back, it is smooth.
* Add a search bar to find movies and enhance user experiences
* Change look and feel with a more detailed view.
